Overview\n\nThis document outlines the data science strategy for the F1 Fan Analytics & Prediction Platform, revised to support a **full-stack architecture using Supabase**. It details the methodologies for server-side data ingestion, the database schema, the machine learning model training and prediction pipeline, and the implementation of the \"Agent\" and Generative AI assistant. This design replaces the previous client-centric approach.\n\n## 2. Data Ingestion and Storage\n\nThe platform's data integrity is maintained by a centralized PostgreSQL database on Supabase, which serves as the single source of truth. Data is populated and updated through a robust, server-side ingestion pipeline.\n\n### 2.1. Data Sources\n\n1.  **Ergast API**: Primary source for historical race results, driver/constructor standings, season schedules, and circuit information.\n2.  **FastF1 API**: Used for detailed session data, including lap-by-lap times, positions, tire compounds, and pit stops, which are crucial for feature engineering.\n\n### 2.2. Ingestion Pipeline\n\n-   **Initial Load**: A dedicated **Data Ingestion Service** (running as an external compute service) will perform a one-time bulk import of historical data from the Ergast and FastF1 APIs into the Supabase database.\n-   **Live Data Handling**: During live race sessions, this service will poll the F1 Data API at a high frequency (e.g., every 5 seconds). The incoming data (lap times, positions, etc.) will be broadcasted via **Supabase Realtime** to subscribed clients and persisted to the `race_results` table upon completion.\n-   **Data Storage**: All data will be stored in the Supabase PostgreSQL database, following the schema defined in the System Design Document. This eliminates the need for client-side caching (`localStorage`) and ensures data consistency.\n\n## 3. Database Schema\n\nAll data science components will interact with the central PostgreSQL database. The schema is detailed in the **System Design Document's ER Diagram**. Key tables for data science include:\n\n-   `drivers`, `constructors`, `circuits`, `seasons`, `races`: Core entities of the F1 domain.\n-   `race_results`: Stores final and in-progress results, serving as the primary source for model training features.\n-   `predictions`: Stores the outputs of our ML models, such as predicted race winners and their confidence scores.\n-   `profiles`: Stores user-specific information, like favorite drivers, which can be used for personalizing the user experience.\n\n## 4. Machine Learning Model Pipeline\n\nThe ML pipeline is designed as a server-centric workflow, moving all training and prediction generation off the client. This allows for more complex models and ensures predictions are always up-to-date without client-side computation.\n\n### 4.1. Race Winner Prediction\n\n-   **Objective**: Predict the probability of each driver winning an upcoming race.\n-   **Model**: **Gradient Boosting Classifier (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)**. This model offers high accuracy and can handle complex interactions between features.\n-   **Features**:\n    -   Driver's rolling average performance (grid position, finishing position, points) over the last 5-10 races.\n    -   Constructor's rolling average performance.\n    -   Driver's historical performance at the specific circuit.\n    -   Qualifying position for the upcoming race.\n    -   Championship standing.\n    -   Engine and component usage data, if available.\n-   **Training & Prediction Process**:\n    1.  The **ML Model Worker** fetches training data from the `race_results` and related tables in the Supabase DB.\n    2.  The model is retrained after each race to incorporate the latest results.\n    3.  The trained model artifact (e.g., a `.pkl` or `.joblib` file) is versioned and saved to **Supabase Storage**.\n    4.  After qualifying, the worker generates predictions for the upcoming race and stores them in the `predictions` table, linked to the `race_id` and `driver_id`.\n\n### 4.2. Tire Strategy & Pit Stop Prediction\n\n-   **Objective**: Predict tire degradation and optimal pit stop windows.\n-   **Model**: A combination of **Linear Regression** (to model lap time drop-off per tire compound) and a **survival model** (to predict the probability of a tire lasting a certain number of laps).\n-   **Features**:\n    -   `lap_number` (on current tire stint)\n    -   `tire_compound`\n    -   `track_id` (as a categorical feature)\n    -   `fuel_load_estimate` (calculated based on lap number)\n    -   `track_temperature` and `air_temperature` (if available).\n-   **Process**: This model will also be managed by the ML Model Worker, with its outputs potentially stored as serialized JSON objects or in a dedicated table if needed for the frontend.\n\n## 5. The \"Agent\": Automated Data & Model Maintenance\n\nThe \"Agent\" is a collection of automated server-side processes responsible for keeping the platform's data and models current, accurate, and self-improving.\n\n### 5.1. Data Freshness Agent\n\n-   **Implementation**: A **Supabase Edge Function** scheduled to run periodically (e.g., daily) using `pg_cron`.\n-   **Responsibilities**:\n    -   **Scan for Updates**: The function will query external APIs (e.g., Ergast) to check for changes in driver lineups, constructor names, or the race calendar.\n    -   **Update Database**: If discrepancies are found, the function will update the `drivers`, `constructors`, and `races` tables accordingly. For example, if a driver switches teams, their `constructor_id` for the current season will be updated.\n    -   **Logging**: All actions taken by the agent will be logged to a dedicated `logs` table for monitoring and auditing.\n\n### 5.2. Model Retraining & Drift Detection Agent (ML Worker)\n\n-   **Implementation**: An external **ML Model Worker** service, which can be triggered by a **Supabase Database Hook**.\n-   **Workflow**:\n    1.  **Trigger**: A `AFTER INSERT` hook on the `race_results` table can call a webhook that initiates the ML Worker once a race's results are fully populated.\n    2.  **Retraining**: The worker executes the model retraining pipeline as described in Section 4.\n    3.  **Model Evaluation & Drift Detection**:\n        -   After retraining, the new model is evaluated on a hold-out dataset (e.g., the last 3 races).\n        -   Its performance (e.g., Brier Score, accuracy) is compared against the currently deployed model.\n        -   If the new model shows a statistically significant improvement, it is promoted to \"production\" (i.e., its artifact is marked as the latest version in Supabase Storage).\n        -   This prevents model performance from degrading over time (model drift) and ensures the platform's predictions continuously improve.\n    4.  **Prediction Generation**: The newly validated model is used to generate and store predictions for the next race.\n\n## 6. GenAI-Powered F1 Assistant Architecture\n\nThe F1 assistant is implemented as a secure and context-aware backend service, protecting API keys and centralizing logic.\n\n-   **Implementation**: A dedicated **Supabase Edge Function** (`/functions/v1/ask-apex`).\n-   **Architecture Flow**:\n    1.  **User Input**: The user asks a question in the frontend chat interface.\n    2.  **API Call**: The client sends the user's query to the `ask-apex` Edge Function.\n    3.  **Context Assembly (Server-Side)**: The Edge Function receives the query and fetches relevant context directly from the Supabase DB. This includes race data, user profile information (e.g., favorite driver), and historical stats.\n    4.  **Dynamic Prompt Engineering**: The function constructs a detailed, context-rich prompt for the LLM, similar to the v1 design but now executed securely on the backend.\n    5.  **Secure LLM Call**: The Edge Function calls the third-party LLM API (e.g., OpenAI) using an API key stored securely as a Supabase secret.\n    6.  **Response Handling**: The response is streamed back from the function to the client for display. This architecture prevents exposure of API keys and offloads complex logic from the client.\n\"\"\"\n\nasync def main():\n    await editor.write(\"docs/data_science_design.md\", data_science_design_content)\n\nasyncio.run(main())",

The analysis reveals **significant gaps** that explain the user's dissatisfaction.\n\n### Critical Findings:\n- ❌ **0% of ML/AI features implemented** - No machine learning models deployed\n- ❌ **30% of data pipeline implemented** - Manual sync only, no automation\n- ❌ **40% of UI features implemented** - Basic components only, no predictions or analytics\n- ❌ **0% of FastF1 integration** - Only using Ergast API (limited data)\n- ❌ **0% of Agent system** - No autonomous data updates\n\n---\n\n## 1. Data Ingestion & Storage\n\n### Planned Architecture:\n- **Data Sources**: Ergast API + FastF1 API for detailed telemetry\n- **Ingestion Pipeline**: \n  - Initial bulk load of historical data\n  - Live data polling every 5 seconds during races\n  - Supabase Realtime broadcasting\n- **Automatic Sync**: Agent runs periodically to update data\n\n### Current Implementation:\n- ✅ Supabase database schema created (8 tables)\n- ✅ Basic Ergast API integration\n- ❌ **NO FastF1 integration** - Missing telemetry, lap times, tire data\n- ❌ **Manual sync only** - Requires admin to click \"Sync Data\" button\n- ❌ **No live data polling** - No real-time updates during races\n- ❌ **No Realtime broadcasting** - No WebSocket connections\n- ❌ **Empty database** - No initial data load on deployment\n\n### Gap Impact: **CRITICAL**\nUsers see \"Loading...\" everywhere because the database is empty and there's no automatic data population.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Machine Learning Pipeline\n\n### Planned Architecture:\n\n#### 2.1 Race Winner Prediction\n- **Model**: Gradient Boosting Classifier (XGBoost/LightGBM)\n- **Features**: \n  - Rolling average performance (last 5-10 races)\n  - Constructor performance\n  - Circuit-specific history\n  - Qualifying position\n  - Championship standing\n- **Training**: After each race\n- **Storage**: Model artifacts in Supabase Storage\n- **Output**: Predictions table with confidence scores\n\n#### 2.2 Tire Strategy & Pit Stop Prediction\n- **Model**: Linear Regression + Survival Model\n- **Features**:\n  - Lap number on current stint\n  - Tire compound\n  - Track ID\n  - Fuel load estimate\n  - Track/air temperature\n- **Output**: Optimal pit windows, degradation curves\n\n#### 2.3 ML Worker Architecture\n- External compute service\n- Triggered by database hooks after race completion\n- Model retraining pipeline\n- Drift detection and validation\n- Automated deployment\n\n### Current Implementation:\n- ❌ **NO ML models** - Zero machine learning implementation\n- ❌ **NO model training** - No training pipeline\n- ❌ **NO predictions generation** - Edge function exists but generates random data\n- ❌ **NO model storage** - No artifacts in Supabase Storage\n- ❌ **NO ML Worker** - No external compute service\n- ❌ **NO automated retraining** - No MLOps pipeline\n- ❌ **NO feature engineering** - No data preprocessing\n\n### Current \"Prediction\" Logic:",
